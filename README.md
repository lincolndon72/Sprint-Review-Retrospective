I interpret user needs by the developers gathering and understanding exactly what users want and designs a specific project to the users needs.

# How do creating "user stories" help with this?
By creating a user story it helps simplify the process which is understood by both developers and users. "It breaks the requirements into small chunks of functionality that can be built incrementally."(Cobb, 2015)

In developing a program the developer should have a precise understanding of what the stakeholder, customer, and user want in the program, so he/she can design and incorporate it in the program.
